I have an Object like this:
var recipe: {
                    recipeName: meal.strMeal,
                    instruction: meal.strInstructions,
                    videoId: youtube_parser(meal.strYoutube),
                    video: meal.strYoutube,
                    thumb: meal.strMealThumb,
                    nation: meal.strArea,
                    category: meal.strCategory,
                    ingredients: [object, object, object, etc]
             }

Because the data shows seperate strMeasure and strIngredient as seperate I have to marry the two 
to make it a readable ingredient like this: 

 for (var i = 1; i <= 54; i++) {
                    if (!meal['strIngredient' + i]) {
                        break;
                    }
                    recipe.ingredients.push({
                        ingredient: meal['strMeasure' + i] + " " + meal['strIngredient' + i]
					});
                }

That marries the measure to the correct ingredient so it's easy to work with.
and it pushes to the ingredient to the ingredients array at the same time.. 
so you end up with the structure below

ingredients: [{ingredients0: 1 cup milk}
              {ingredients1: 1/2 cup chocolate chips}
              {ingredients2: etc...}
              ]

I then loop through them with a for loop and present them on the front end as a list..... 
works great in present format the problem is if I try to put them in a popup button format
like the instructions then if I have 10 ingredients I get 10 buttons... only want 1 button :)
I've tried all the magic I know and the problem is I'm WAY over thinking this .....  I need to 
get them into one object as a list so in the front end I can just use the key:value method to put
them in a button so it pops up with the list :)

Ie: <div class="modal-content">Ingredients:<br>${mixins.ingredients}</div>

And get one button instead of 10 LOL


Currently: 
Structure is : ingredients: [
                            {ingredient: blah}, 
                            {ingredient: mix}, 
                            {etc}
                            ]
Want/need :  ingredients: {1 cup milk, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, etc}  
             or 
             ingredients: [{1 cup milk, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, etc}]

On the front end I have parsed them differently........everything but the ingredients are in this.mixins
ingredients are in this.list if you were confused by what you were seeing :)
